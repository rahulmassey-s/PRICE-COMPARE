# Wallet Admin Dashboard Updates

## Overview
This document describes the updates made to the admin dashboard to properly handle wallet point redemptions and show transaction history.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Balance Calculation
- **Problem**: Admin dashboard was calculating balances using `wallet.type` field, but `redeemPoints` function creates transactions with `action: 'redeem'` field.
- **Solution**: Updated `loadUserWallets()` function to handle both old format (`type: 'add'/'deduct'`) and new format (`action: 'redeem'`, etc.).

### 2. Added Transaction History Modal
- **New Feature**: Added a "View Transactions" button next to each user in the wallet accounts table.
- **Modal**: Created a new modal that shows detailed transaction history for each user.
- **Columns**: Date, Action, Points, Status, Details

### 3. Updated Transaction Format
- **Admin Actions**: Updated admin's "Manage Points" form to create transactions with the new format:
  - `action: 'manual-add'` or `action: 'manual-deduct'`
  - `points: positive` or `points: negative`
  - `status: 'completed'`

### 4. Real-time Balance Updates
- **User Balance**: Admin dashboard now uses the actual `pointsBalance` from the user document instead of calculating from transactions.
- **Fallback**: Still calculates from transactions as a fallback if user document doesn't have balance.

## Files Modified

### 1. `public/admin/app.js`
- Updated `loadUserWallets()` function to handle both transaction formats
- Added `openWalletTransactionHistoryModal()` function
- Added modal close event listeners
- Updated wallet points form to use new transaction format

### 2. `public/admin/index.html`
- Added new modal HTML for transaction history
- Added "View Transactions" button to wallet accounts table

## How It Works

### When User Redeems Points:
1. `redeemPoints()` function creates a transaction with:
   - `action: 'redeem'`
   - `points: -pointsToRedeem`
   - `status: 'completed'`
2. User's `pointsBalance` is updated in the users collection
3. Admin dashboard shows the updated balance immediately

### When Admin Manages Points:
1. Admin clicks "Manage Points" button
2. Form creates transaction with:
   - `action: 'manual-add'` or `action: 'manual-deduct'`
   - `points: positive` or `points: negative`
   - `status: 'completed'`
3. User's `pointsBalance` is updated
4. Transaction appears in user's transaction history

### Viewing Transaction History:
1. Admin clicks "View Transactions" button
2. Modal opens showing all transactions for that user
3. Transactions are sorted by date (newest first)
4. Shows action type, points change, status, and details

## Transaction Types Supported

### Old Format (Legacy):
- `type: 'add'` - Add points
- `type: 'deduct'` - Deduct points

### New Format (Current):
- `action: 'redeem'` - User redeemed points
- `action: 'earn'` - User earned points
- `action: 'referral-share'` - Referral bonus
- `action: 'manual-add'` - Admin added points
- `action: 'manual-deduct'` - Admin deducted points

## Testing

To test the functionality:

1. **User Redemption**: Have a user redeem points in the app
2. **Admin Dashboard**: Check that the balance updates in admin dashboard
3. **Transaction History**: Click "View Transactions" to see the redemption
4. **Admin Management**: Use "Manage Points" to add/deduct points
5. **Verify**: Check that all transactions appear in the history

## Benefits

1. **Real-time Updates**: Admin can see point changes immediately
2. **Complete History**: Full transaction history for each user
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Supports both old and new transaction formats
4. **Better UX**: Clear transaction details and status
5. **Audit Trail**: All point changes are tracked with reasons and admin actions
